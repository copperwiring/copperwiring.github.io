However, we don’t intend to send out this data to any algorithm in 3 fold i.e. sending for one channel and doing computation, sending for second and so on. This is very unrealistic from computation point of you because our original data (pixel values) are ‘together’ representing the image. Hence, we create what we call a feature vector. We create 1-D column vector with values from these 3 color channels. For instance, we start from Red channel and bread each value row wise till the last value. Next we do the same for Blue channel and lastly for Green channel. This gives us one single column vector representing the original image in the form of, what we call, ‘feature vector’. So, what is the final size of the feature vector? This is important to know the total amount of data we will eventually use to do any computation.\nWhen we see the CNN structure, we see that the architecture is defined usingm x n x 3, in case of RGB images.

Political news, crisis reports, few wikipedia sources and I landed up this page. Now, wait. This gets interesting. I have seen this guy before on Twitter and that too very recently. I was right! It\u0026rsquo;s right in the second paragraph of the page. He was the Nobel Peace Prize recipient for 2019. And I now I wanted to read all about it.\nSometimes it takes one small interest or familar news which can pique your interest.\nNile river dispute started all the way back in 2010 (actually it\u0026rsquo;s much more older than this but more about it later). I believe everyone had heard of river Nile. It is one of the longest flowing river in the world that passes through Egypt, Sudan and Ethopia. You can check out the worldmap here. It is so large that if you take a round trip of the Nile river, you will have walked the distance of the diameter of the Earth. It\u0026rsquo;s huge!\nComing back to the dispute. To understand this water dispute, one needs to understand the flow of this river betwwen the three countries. Nile has a downstream flow when it flows down from Ethopia to Sudan to Egypt. Historicaly, as we know from our high school geography books, Egyptian civilization flourished around the basins of the Nile river. Till today, Egypt is highly dependent in Nile for its irrigation needs. Now, any disruptions to this downstream flow of water may affect the economy of Egypy. Atleast this is what Egypt is claiming. This is where the dispute of the Nile river omes in.\nIn 2010, Ethopian government surveyed the area around river Nile in their country and a year later, announced the construction of one of the biggest dams that was expected to generate 45 GW (cuurent estimate is 60+ GW) of hydro-electricity. This dam has been called by different names: \u0026lsquo;Project X\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Millenium Dam\u0026rsquo; and as currently called \u0026lsquo;Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam\u0026rsquo;. Till date the project is almost 60% completed but has, since it\u0026rsquo;s incetion, created a political conflict in the country.\nWhere Ethopia on one hand relaizes that this dam can substancially raise the standards of the country\u0026rsquo;s economic condition, Egypt believes that the dam will adversarily affect the already crumbling Egyptian economy.\nThis is what\u0026rsquo;s happening between Egypt on north and Ethopia in the south. Where does Sudan come into play? It\u0026rsquo;s right in the middle of the political deadlock and completes the triangle of nations in this dispute. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea. It finds itself in unique position as, being a downstream nation, it has same concerns as Eqypt, however, it needs the hydropower generated by the Ethopian dam. from most news sources, it appears that Sudan is siding with Ethopia on the dam construction for now, conditionally.I have yet to find a good resource on what Sudan\u0026rsquo;s condition are. I will update the post once I find one.\nAnd btw, remember the guy I was talking about initially.He is Abyi Ahmed Ali, the current Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethopia.\n","date":1573190466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573190466,"objectID":"eb88e37724edbbb3eed2b5078895ec9d","permalink":"https://srishti.dev/post/2019-11-08-nile-rive-dispute/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T22:21:06-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-11-08-nile-rive-dispute/","section":"post","summary":"It all started with one news article here and I went down a rabbit hole as to what is this Nile dispute all about.

See the live demo. See it in action on my own blog.  Welcome to the sample post for the Jekyll Clean theme.\nA simple and clean Jekyll theme using bootstrap (not to be confused with jekyll-bootstrap) that\u0026rsquo;s easy to modify and very modular in component and element reuse.\nIt uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support. Both of these features are disabled by default and can be enabled via _config.yml. You can also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html). The beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean\u0026hellip; Jekyll Clean!\nThe theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the sidebar. The links pane in the sidebar is available on mobile through the nav menu, and you can do the same thing for any other sections added to the sidebar.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to occassionally merge against my upstream repository so you can get the latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!\nInstallation If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a blog already on github, start by cloning this repository. Best to do that directly on github and then clone that down to your computer.\nIf you already do have a blog, You can certainly apply this theme to your existing blog in place, but then you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to merge as the theme changes. If you re-apply your blog history on top of this theme\u0026rsquo;s gh-pages branch, it\u0026rsquo;s then easy to update to the latest version of the theme. You also don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to deal with resolving old conflicts from your existing history, so you may wish to to push your existing master off to a new branch so you have the old history and start a new branch with this as the start, merging in your _posts and other assets (after git rm\u0026rsquo;ing the current _posts.\nNot ideal, but you have to make a choice - either apply it manually or base your blog off this theme\u0026rsquo;s branch. Either way it will work, and both have their own pros and cons.\nYou can setup an upstream tracking repository like so:\n$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:scotte/jekyll-clean.git  And now when you wish to merge your own branch onto the latest version of the theme, simply do:\n$ git fetch upstream $ git merge upstream/gh-pages  Of course you will have to resolve conflicts for _config.yml, _includes/links-list.html, and _posts, and so on, but in practice this is pretty simple.\nThis is how I maintain my own blog which is based on this theme. The old history is sitting in an old-master branch that I can refer to when I need to.\nRunning Locally Here\u0026rsquo;s the exact set of packages I need to install on Debian to run jekyll locally with this theme for testing.\n$ sudo aptitude install ruby ruby-dev rubygems nodejs $ sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-paginate  And then it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple matter of running jekyll locally:\n$ jekyll serve --baseurl=''  Now browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000\nUsing gh-pages Running a jekyll site is a bit outside the scope of this doc, but sometimes it can be a bit confusing how to configure jekyll for project pages versus user pages, for example.\nTo start with, read through the documentation here. This will provide a good overview on how it all works. The git branch and baseurl (in _config.yml) will change depending on the sort of site deployed.\nWhen you clone this repository, it\u0026rsquo;s set up for project pages, so the deployed branch is \u0026ldquo;gh-pages\u0026rdquo; and baseurl is configured to \u0026lsquo;jekyll-clean\u0026rsquo;, because that\u0026rsquo;s the name of this project.\nIf you plan to deploy this as user pages, the deployed branch is \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; and baseurl is configured to '\u0026rsquo; (i.e. empty).\nComment Systems Jekyll clean supports both isso and disqus comment systems.\nAfter enabling comments, either isso or disquss must be configured. Don\u0026rsquo;t try configuring both!\nIsso Comments Isso requires running a local server, so is not suitable for hosting in github pages, for example. Isso is open source and keeps all your data local, unlike Disqus (who knows exactly what they are doing with your data).\nIn _config.yml you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set isso to the fully-qualified URL if your isso server (this is the value for data-isso passed to the isso JS). Make sure comments is true.\nDisqus Comments Getting Disqus to work can be a bit more work than it seems like it should be. Make sure your Disqus account is correctly configured with the right domain of your blog and you know your Disqus shortname.\nIn _config.yml you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set disqus to your Disqus shortname and make sure comments is true.\nFinally, in posts, make sure you have comments: true in the YAML front matter.\nMore information on using Disqus with Jekyll is documented here.\nCode Syntax Highlighting To use code syntax highlighting, use the following syntax:\n```python import random # Roll the die roll = random.randint(1, 20) print('You rolled a %d.' % roll) ``` #REMOVE  (Remove #REMOVE from the end of the last line). Which will look like this in the rendered jekyll output using the default css/syntax.css provided with this theme (which is the colorful theme from https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax):\nimport random # Roll the die roll = random.randint(1, 20) print('You rolled a %d.' % roll)  You can, of course, use any theme you wish, see the jekyll and pygments documentation for more details.\nLicense The content of this theme is distributed and licensed under a ![License Badge]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/cc_by_88x31.png) Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\nThis license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.
